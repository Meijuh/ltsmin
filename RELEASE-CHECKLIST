Release Checklist
=================

* If first release of the year, update the copyright data in COPYING

* Update NEWS with release notes, note that
  NEWS is a sym link to changelog.md.
  Having this sym link means we remain compatible with 
  autoconf.

* Verify the version (v<MAJOR><MINOR><PATH>) in configure.ac.

* Verify the LTSmin version (v<MAJOR><MINOR><PATCH>)
  in the website config: _config.yml.

* Copy the new HTML manpages to assets/man.

* Tag release
  git tag v<MAJOR><MINOR><PATCH>

* make distcheck (creates tarball and checks whether it builds)
  To test specific configurations:
    make distcheck DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS='...'

* Push the tag to origin, Travis will perform the release for you :)

* Bump the version in configure.ac, and _config.yml, 
  and commit to master.
