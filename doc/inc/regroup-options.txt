gs;;
  Group Safely; macro for "*gc*,*gr*,*cw*,*rs*"; almost
  always a win.

ga;;
  Group Aggressively (row subsumption); macro for
  "*gc*,*rs*,*ru*,*cw*,*rs*"; can be a huge win, but in some
  cases causes slower state space generation.

gsa;;
  Group Simulated Annealing; macro for "*gc*,*gr*,*csa*,*rs*"; almost
  always a win; usually better than *gs*.

gc;;
  Group Columns; macro for "*cs*,*cn*".

gr;;
  Group Rows; macro for "*rs*,*rn*".

cs;;
  Column Sort; sort columns lexicographically.

cn;;
  Column Nub; (temporarily) group duplicate columns, thereby making
  'ca' more tractable.  Requires *cs*.

cw;;
  Column sWap; minimize distance between columns by swapping them
  heuristically.  This reordering improves performance of the symbolic
  data structures.

ca;;
  Column All permutations; try to find the column permutation with the
  best cost metric.  Potentially, this is an expensive operation.

csa;;
  Column Simulated Annealing; minimize distance between columns by
  swapping them using simulated annealing.

rs;;
  Row Sort; sort rows lexicographically.

rn;;
  Row Nub; remove duplicate rows from the dependency matrix.  This is
  always a win.  Requires *rs*.

ru;;
  Row sUbsume; try to remove more rows than nubbing, thereby trading
  speed for memory.  Requires *rs*.

w2W;;
  Over-approximate all must-write to may-write. May-write supports the copy (-) dependency.
    
r2+;;
  Over-approximate read to read+write. Allows read dependencies to also subsume write dependencies.
  
w2+;;
  Over-approximate must-write to read+write. Allows must-write dependencies to also subsume read dependencies.

W2+;;
  Over-approximate may-write to read+write. Allows must-write dependencies to also subsume read dependencies.

rb4w;;
  Use special heuristics to move read dependencies before write dependences. Often a win in symbolic state space generation.
  
bg;;
  Use a bipartite graph (default) for *bcm*, *bk*, *bs*, *vcm*, *vacm* and *vgps*.

tg;;
  Create a total graph of the bipartite graph for *bcm*, *bk*, *bs*, *vcm*, *vacm* and *vgps*.
  This adds more vertices and edges thus increasing computation time, but sometimes provides a better ordering.
  
bcm;;
  Apply Boost's Cuthill-McKee ordering.
  
bk;;
  Apply Boost's King ordering.

bs;;
  Apply Boost's Sloan ordering.
  
vcm;;
  Apply ViennaCL's Cuthill-McKee ordering.
  
vacm;;
  Apply ViennaCL's advanced Cuthill-McKee ordering.
  
vgps;;
  Apply ViennaCl's Gibbs-Poole-Stockmeyer ordering.
